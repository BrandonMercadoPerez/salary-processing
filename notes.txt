NOTES – Salary Processing Lab 8 (Chapter 7)

This file explains the design decisions, parsing logic, and calculation rules used in the Salary Processing (Lab 8) C++ program. The goal of this document is to clarify how time values, pay grades, and department summaries are handled using only introductory-level C++ concepts.

## GENERAL PROGRAM FLOW

1. The program reads payroll data line-by-line from input.txt.
2. Department headers are identified by lines beginning with the word "The".
3. Employee records are processed until a new department header is found.
4. Payroll totals are calculated and displayed per department.
5. All tracking variables are reset before moving to the next department.

The program avoids advanced C++ features and uses only:

* ifstream for file input
* string manipulation (find, substr, erase)
* conditionals and loops
* basic helper functions

## TIME PARSING AND ROUNDING RULES

Time values in the input file may appear in many formats, such as:

* "8 hours"
* "7hrs"
* "10 hours 12 minutes"
* "6min"
* "1hr 34 minutes"

To handle this unstructured input, the program scans for:

* 'h' or 'hrs' to detect hours
* 'm' or 'min' to detect minutes

Minutes are converted using the following rounding rules:

* 1 to 29 minutes → 0.5 hours
* 30 to 59 minutes → 1.0 hour
* 0 minutes → 0.0 hours

These rules are implemented in a helper function that converts minutes into fractional hours.

## F1 AND F2 EMPLOYEE PROCESSING

F1 and F2 employees list only time values.

The program:

* Extracts all hour and minute values from the line
* Accumulates total minutes and total hours
* Converts remaining minutes to fractional hours
* Returns total hours worked for that employee

Pay rules:

* F1: Total hours × $12.15
* F2: $500 base salary
  + overtime pay for hours above 35 at $18.95/hour

## F3 EMPLOYEE PROCESSING (COMMISSION)

F3 employees do not list time worked. Instead, they list:

* Sales amount (may contain commas)
* Commission rate

Processing steps:

1. The dollar sign is located to extract the sales amount.
2. Commas are removed manually before conversion to a number.
3. The commission rate is read as a decimal value.
4. Work hours are assigned as:

   * 30 hours if commission ≤ 10%
   * 40 hours if commission > 10%

Pay rule:

* Salary = sales amount × commission rate

---

## F4 EMPLOYEE PROCESSING (DAILY ENTRIES)

F4 employees have exactly 7 time entries, representing:

* Monday through Friday (weekday)
* Saturday and Sunday (weekend)

Processing logic:

* Time entries are read sequentially from left to right.
* The first 5 entries are counted as weekday hours.
* The last 2 entries are counted as weekend hours.

Hour-minute pairing rules:

* If minutes immediately follow hours, they are combined and rounded.
* Standalone minutes are rounded independently.

Pay rules:

* Weekday hours × $26.55
* Weekend hours × $39.75

---

## DEPARTMENT SUMMARY OUTPUT

For each department, the program displays:

* Department name
* Total salary
* Total hours worked
* Total number of employees
* Employee roster (names)

Additionally, per-pay-grade statistics are shown:

* Total salary per grade
* Total hours per grade
* Number of employees per grade

Output is formatted using iomanip to create clean, boxed tables.

## DESIGN NOTES

* All parsing is done using basic string functions.
* No vectors, stringstreams, or advanced STL containers are used.
* Variables are reset after each department to avoid data leakage.
* The program prioritizes readability and correctness over optimization.

This design aligns strictly with introductory programming course expectations while handling complex, real-world-style input data.
